        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p><b>In June 2023, San Juan Islands First Nations Development Committee approved the construction of a lodge resort at Moffat Bay on Joviedsa Island.</b></p>
            <p><b>We are</b> hospitality and event experts with decades of cumulative experience, given the support of the First Nations Development Committee to manage the lodge and guest experience for Moffat Bay.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>We are</b> a collection of leisure-lovers and thrill-seekers much like our guests. Allow us the opportunity to curate your experience with guided hiking tours and kayaking outings, or take on the adventuring mantle yourself and explore the beautiful wilderness of Joviedsa Island.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>We are</b> champions of Coast Salish culture and environmental advocates. We are here to provide a peerless experience for our guests while also protecting the beautiful waters and trails that we inhabit.</p>

        <h2>Our Guiding Principles</h2>
        <p><b>Lighthouses for centuries have guided ships and sailors to port safely. Likewise our principles keep us on the right path to uphold the values we share.</b></p>
        <p><b>A commitment to culture:</b> The ground we tread and waters we traverse are of great significance to the Coast Salish people. We work to ensure that our business helps amplify and celebrate this culture rather than harm it. We expect our guests to share this commitment.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>A commitment to preservation:</b> The natural beauty and allure of these islands has persisted throughout the years and we aim to keep them that way. We work to ensure our business operates in the most sustainable manner possible.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>A commitment to you:</b> Our guests are of course a top priority. We strive to ensure your time here is as peaceful or as adventurous as you want it to be. Whatever adventures you have planned, you can always count on returning to the lodge and being greeted by our friendly staff. We always want your time spent to be as pleasant as possible.</p>
